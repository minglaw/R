Hello,

The accompanying files will have R code that use 'ggplot2' to make nice and neat graphs of data pulled from a Point of Sales (POS) system database.

As of late, I've been attempting to figure out how to best represent the data. 'ggplot2' easily has the most robust visuals within R so I'll probably stick with that.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns feel free to voice them.

Thanks,

Ming
